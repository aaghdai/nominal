# Global Variables Schema
# This file defines all possible global variables that can be used across all rules.
# Individual rule files should only reference a subset of these variables that are
# relevant to their specific form type.

# Global variables are batch-level variables that are consistent across a group of PDF files.
# They represent information about the person/taxpayer that appears across multiple forms.

global_variables:
  # Personal identification
  - FIRST_NAME          # First name of the taxpayer/recipient
  - LAST_NAME           # Last name of the taxpayer/recipient
  - FULL_NAME           # Full name (alternative to FIRST_NAME/LAST_NAME, used for recipients)
  - TIN_LAST_FOUR       # Last four digits of TIN/SSN (extracted directly from forms)

  # Additional identification (can be added as needed)
  # - EMPLOYER_NAME
  # - EMPLOYER_EIN
  # - ADDRESS
  # - CITY
  # - STATE
  # - ZIP_CODE

# Note: Rules should only declare global variables that they actually use.
# The processor will validate that all declared global variables are defined in this schema.
